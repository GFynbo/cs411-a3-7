# Team 7 User Alternative Recipes Story
*Gavin, Rachel, Uthrash, Ivanna*

## As a logged in user, if my search for recipes does not return results, I want to have alternative options

*If no recipe is found, the application would return no results and suggest recipes that need more of something you already have, or only need a few more ingredients, with an amazon pantry link to order the ingredients. It would also return recipes that you don’t have the full list of ingredients for, but you could use your current ingredients as substitutions. (i.e. the user doesn’t have bread crumbs, but could use their quinoa instead)*
