# Team 7 User Login Story
*Gavin, Rachel, Uthrash, Ivanna*

## As a user I want to be able to login in with my google or twitter account and view my pantry items

*For this story the user first needs to be greeted with the homepage/login screen in order to access their account. Once logged in, the user can then navigate to their pantry and see their current items including items that have reached zero supply. If the user fails to login it will redirect back to the login page with specific errors.*
