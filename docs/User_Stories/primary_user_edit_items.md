# Team 7 User Edit Items Story
*Gavin, Rachel, Uthrash, Ivanna*

## As a logged in user I want to be able to add or edit ingredients to my pantry.

*If the user is logged in, they should then be on or able to move to their pantry and edit items, this includes: adding, deleting, and editing amounts. If the user attempts to delete or edit a non-existent recipe it will return an error, otherwise the user will be prompted for a confirmation for editing or deleting and the process will complete. For adding new items, if it exists in our database it will auto-complete and if not it will add it to the user pantry as a custom entry.*
