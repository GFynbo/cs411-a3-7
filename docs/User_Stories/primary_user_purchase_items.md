# Team 7 User Purchase Items Story
*Gavin, Rachel, Uthrash, Ivanna*

## As a logged in user, I want to be able to directly place items in a grocery cart from a chosen recipe that are not available in my own pantry

*For this story the user will choose have searched for and chosen a recipe that has some/most of the ingredients available in his/her pantry. The user will then be able to add the ingredients missing from their pantry to a grocery cart (link to instacart or amazon pantry). If the user chooses to add an item that users usually get along with another item, it will suggest to add that item as well. If the user chooses to add an item from the recipe that already exists in their pantry, it will notify them that the ingredient is already in their pantry and will ask if they are sure they want to add such item. Once the items are in the grocery cart, the user can remove any item before proceeding to check out.*
