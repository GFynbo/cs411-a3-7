# Team 7 User Recipe Completion Story
*Gavin, Rachel, Uthrash, Ivanna*

## As a logged in user when I complete a recipe I want my pantry to automatically update.

*Once the user is logged in, they will be able to mark a recipe as complete and once they do.The userâ€™s pantry will automatically update and remove the items they used to complete that recipe. If the user completes a recipe and their pantry is not automatically updated, they can refresh their pantry and/or manually remove items from their pantry.*
