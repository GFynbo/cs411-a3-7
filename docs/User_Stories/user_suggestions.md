# Team 7 User Recipe Suggestions Story
*Gavin, Rachel, Uthrash, Ivanna*

## As a logged in user I want to be able to see recipe suggestions from my available ingredients

*Once the user is logged in, they will have access to their previously entered pantry items. From here, the user will be able to generate a list of recipes that use the ingredients in their saved pantry. Ideally, this is a simple process at the tap of a button. If no recipe is found, the application would return no results.*
