# Team 7 User Favorites Story
*Gavin, Rachel, Uthrash, Ivanna*

## As a logged in user, I want to be able to mark recipes I enjoyed most as favorite and later search for my favorite recipes

*In this situation the user would follow the login user story and then attempt to mark recipes as favorites and search for them in my Recipes section. If I search for a non-existent recipe then it will return and error with an empty search. Otherwise, it will return all results based on some searching algorithm which could be as simple as a word-for-word title search.*
