The Technology stack we chose is Django, based on python with a server included. 
We considered the mean stack - mongo, express, angular,  and node.
We also considered the mern stack - mongo, express, react, and node. 
Django was chosen because everyone on the team has experience utilizing Python, and a few members had experience with Django specifically. 
Django also allows us to use a model view controller framework type. This framework allows a way to efficiently separate components.  
Django also allows us to work with a relational data base as opposed to being restricted non relational database.
