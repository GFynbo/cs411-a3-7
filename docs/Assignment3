For MyPantry, we decided to use the Python Web Framework Django. We also considered using Express, Angular, or Flask. We chose our technology stack by first deciding to use Python. All team members had at least a base knowledge of Python. We liked the flexibility of Python for our project, as well as we liked how approachable it was for team members that havenâ€™t had as much experience with Python. The decision to then use Django, specifically, instead of another Python web framework was based on a few factors. The first being that Django allows us to use a model view controller framework. This way, we could easily separate components to work on. Django also allows us to work with a relational database, if we choose to, and we are not restricted to a non-relational database. Lastly, a few team members had, at the least, a familiarity with Django and were either interested in expanding on that experience or helping other team members understand how a full project can come together in Django.
