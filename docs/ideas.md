# Team 7 Ideas
*Gavin, Rachel, Uthrash, Ivanna*

## Idea One
This web app uses OAuth to store user’s information including pantry ingredients. Uses a database of recipes and database of ingredients. You’re able to look at your pantry and generate a list of recipes with the ingredients available to you. Also allows you to take recipe, find ingredients missing from recipes and allows you to create a grocery list (link instacart). Initially user adds all ingredients in pantry. Once you mark recipe as cooked, clear list of those ingredients in that pantry.

## Idea Two
This web app uses OAuth to store user’s information including location and phone. This web app uses database to store user’s information. The app sends a text/reminder letting the user know what to wear/what to bring out based on the weather forecast for each day. The app would also integrate with Google Maps API or the MBTA to show if there are any possible delays for the day near the user.
